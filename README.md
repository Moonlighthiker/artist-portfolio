I've been making music for about 15 years.<br>
For a long time [music](/music) was the only art form with which I felt an affinity. The music gave me the space I needed to tell the stories I created in my mind. I taught myself to play all of my instruments. That's why I'm a convinced autodidact. <br>
When I really want to achieve something, I overcome every problem on my own. <br>
I play various musical instruments, for example piano, guitar, mandolin, violin and bass.

  <b>In 2015 I started to make <a href="/2D_art/scenes/traditional/">crayon and charcoal drawings.</a></b><br> 
  Actually, I just wanted to illustrate some scenes in a pen & paper role-playing game, which I led. I enjoyed inventing a      story, writing it and then sharing it with my friends. And although one day I had to stop leading pen & paper role-playing    games, I still enjoyed drawing. 
  </p>
  
<p>
  Over time, <a href="/2D_art/characters/digital/" >drawing</a>
  developed into one of my favourite artistic fields of activity.<br>
  Drawing opened up a whole new form of artistic expression to me. <br>
  But for a long time it remained merely a pastime.

  The more I drew, the more complex my art became. I started drawing anthropomorphic creatures and drawing people from my       circle of friends.
  </p>
<p>
  I wanted to tell stories again. Stories that were important to me, that touched topics I identified with, or that were just   emotionally touching.
  </p>
  
<p>
  That's how I found my way to the <a href="/2D_art/comics/" >comics</a>. Here I could tell stories, drawn stories. And I was overjoyed that my stories were   read with enthusiasm.
  </p>
  
<p>
  <img align="left" src="/2D_art/comics/traditional/000.png" height="200"> My first comics were about forbidden love. <br>
  A <a href="/2D_art/comics/traditional/right_of_love/" >princess</a> who falls in love with her chambermaid. Two women whose only crime was to love each other. And although I rarely   found time to work on these stories, it filled me with pride every time I finished a picture.
  </p>

<p>
<b>Around that time I found my way back to "Blender" and was on fire for <a href="/3D_art/" >3D art</a>.</b><br>

Suddenly, completely new possibilities opened up. I was electrified.<br> 
My partner was planning to develop a video game and I realized my chance. 
  </p>
<p>
I could create the artwork for this game and I really wanted to unravel all the secrets there were to discover. 
</p>

<p>
  <img align="right" src="/3D_art/characters/pike.png" height="200"> My first big project was a pike. I wanted to create a creature and make it as realistic as possible. 

I learned about the modifiers, sculpting techniques and how to provide my model with material and texture. My passion for drawing paid off and it was easy for me to give the pike its unique appearance. 
  </p>
  
<p>
As the months went by, I learned a lot and created numerous models. It was getting easier and faster all the time. Soon I began to create my first scenes, my first <a href="/3D_art/stills/" >stills</a>.
  </p>
  
<p>
  <img align="right" src="/3D_art/stills/de_table.png" height="200"> Working with 3D art has changed my life - to a much more positive side. I have become freer, especially as far as my professional career is concerned. 

Working with Blender has many beautiful facets. It combines technical and programmatic elements with art and artistic expression. 

I'm currently working on my <a href="/3D_art/characters/" >characters</a>. Let them learn to walk. I wish for animations for our game and of course I dream of a little animated film.
